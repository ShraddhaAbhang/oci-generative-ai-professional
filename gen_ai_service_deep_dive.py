1) What happens if a period (.) is used as a stop sequence in text generation?

A. The model stops generating text after it reaches the end of the first sentence, even if the token limit is much higher.

B. The model generates additional sentences to complete the paragraph.

C. The model ignores periods and continues generating text until it reaches the token limit.

D. The model stops generating text after it reaches the end of the current paragraph.

--> A


2) What is the purpose of embeddings in natural language processing?

A. To create numerical representations of text that capture the meaning and relationships between words or phrases

B. To increase the complexity and size of text data

C. To compress text data into smaller files for storage

D. To translate text into a different language

--> A


3) What is the purpose of frequency penalties in language model outputs?

A. To ensure that tokens that appear frequently are used more often

B. To reward the tokens that have never appeared in the text

C. To randomly penalize some tokens to increase the diversity of the text

D. To penalize tokens that have already appeared, based on the number of times they have been used

--> D


4) Which is a distinctive feature of GPUs in Dedicated AI Clusters used for generative AI tasks?

A. GPUs are shared with other customers to maximize resource utilization.

B. The GPUs allocated for a customerâ€™s generative AI tasks are isolated from other GPUs.

C. GPUs are used exclusively for storing large data sets, not for computation.

D. Each customer's GPUs are connected via a public Internet network for ease of access.

--> B


5) What is the main advantage of using few-shot model prompting to customize a Large Language Model (LLM)?

A. It eliminates the need for any training or computational resources.

B. It significantly reduces the latency for each model request.

C. It allows the LLM to access a larger data set.

D. It provides examples in the prompt to guide the LLM to better performance with no training cost.

--> D
