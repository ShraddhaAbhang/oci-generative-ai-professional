Correct Answer: It involves understanding the intent and context of the search.
Explanation: Semantic search differs from traditional keyword search in that it involves understanding the intent and context of the search query, rather than relying solely on matching exact keywords in the content.

1. What differentiates Semantic search from traditional keyword search?

It relies solely on matching exact keywords in the content.

It involves understanding the intent and context of the search.

It is based on the date and author of the content.

It depends on the number of times keywords appear in the content.

Correct Answer: They rely on internal knowledge learned during pretraining on a large text corpus.
Explanation: Large Language Models (LLMs) without Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) primarily rely on internal knowledge learned during pretraining on a large text corpus. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, which enables them to learn complex patterns, structures, and relationships within language.

2. Which is a key characteristic of Large Language Models (LLMs) without Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?

They always use an external database for generating responses.

They cannot generate responses without fine-tuning.

They rely on internal knowledge learned during pretraining on a large text corpus.

They use vector databases exclusively to produce answers.

Correct Answer: It evaluates and prioritizes the information retrieved by the Retriever.
Explanation: The Ranker in a text generation system evaluates and prioritizes the information retrieved by the Retriever. After the Retriever sources relevant information from a large corpus or database, the Ranker assesses the retrieved information to determine its relevance, quality, and suitability for the specific task or context. The Ranker may use various criteria and algorithms to evaluate the retrieved information, such as relevance to the user's query, credibility of the source, recency of the information, and other contextual factors.

3. What does the Ranker do in a text generation system?

It interacts with the user to understand the query better.

It generates the final text based on the user's query.

It sources information from databases to use in text generation.

It evaluates and prioritizes the information retrieved by the Retriever.

Correct Answer: The semantic content of data in high-dimensional vectors
Explanation: Embeddings map words or text onto a continuous vector space where similar words are located close to each other. This allows NLP models to capture semantic relationships between words, such as synonyms or related concepts. For example, in a well-trained embedding space, the vectors for "king" and "queen" would be closer to each other than to unrelated words such as "car" or "tree."

4. What do embeddings in Large Language Models (LLMs) represent?

The semantic content of data in high-dimensional vectors

The frequency of each word or pixel in the data

The color and size of the font in textual data

The grammatical structure of sentences in the data

Correct Answer: To generate human-like text using the information retrieved and ranked, along with the user's original query
Explanation: The Generator in a text generation system is responsible for producing human-like text based on the information retrieved and ranked by the system, along with the user's original query or input. After the relevant information has been sourced from external sources by the Retriever and evaluated by the Ranker, the Generator processes this information along with the user's query to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text responses.

5. What is the function of the Generator in a text generation system?

To rank the information based on its relevance to the user's query

To generate human-like text using the information retrieved and ranked, along with the user's original query

To store the generated responses for future use

To collect user queries and convert them into database search terms
